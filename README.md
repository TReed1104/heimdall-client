## Install Guide
To allow for the quick and easy deployment of the local client for Heimdall we have supplied automated installation scripts for different Operating systems.

These scripts automatically download and install the different dependencies and libraries required by the client to work.

**NOTE: There is a known bug with the Window installation script with Anaconda Python.**
